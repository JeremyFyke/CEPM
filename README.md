# CEPM

CEPM (Cumulative Emissions Projection Model) is a (currently) Matlab-based model that is primarily intended to generate global fossil fuel emissions timeseries resulting from a combination of economic, technical, and social inputs.

A full description of the model and a first demonstration of model capabilities is available from this open-access Environmental Research Letters article: [Fyke and Matthews, 2015](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/11/115007/meta).  In particular, the Supplementary Information contains a version of the model equations as of November 2015.
